# radio2spotify

This is the code for a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) app. 

The idea is: you would like to listen to a radio station, but they do not have online streaming. Instead, this app creates a Spotify playlist of the recently played songs for that radio station, no matter where you are. It does this by scraping the recently played songs from the radio station's website and then using Spotify's API to create a playlist of those songs. The stations which I have provided this for are:

* [CD102.5](http://cd1025.com/)
* [WXRT](http://wxrt.cbslocal.com/)

This app would not have been possible without the help of [Sam Zhang](https://github.com/samzhang111). It is licensed MIT.
